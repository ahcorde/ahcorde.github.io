								<h1>Hi. I'm <strong>Alejandro Hernández Cordero</strong>.</h1>
							</header>
              <p>Open Source Robotics contributor which solve robotics and simulation problems efficiently</p>
              <p>I’m a tech-hungry roboticist, from the first day of my professional life I have been designing, building,
								and programming robotic hardware. As part of past projects, I have had the opportunity to develop algorithms,
								libraries and hardware for drones, autonomous vehicles and robotic arms. From this experience,
								I have gained a broad understanding of robotic technologies and have experience developing complex robotic systems.
              </p>
							<p>
								I have 8+ years of experience in developing, maintaining and contributing to open source projects for
								robotics. I am fluent in C++, the language of robotics, and Python and the most common techniques for
								their interoperation. For example, I was involved in rclpy, gz-math, gz-sim and sdformat Python bindings.
								I develop multiple project using ROS and ROS 2 for multiple clients. I have designed/contributed/fixed
								extensively in Gazebo and Gazebo-classic. I created the gz-omni project which allows Gazebo and Issac
								Sim to interoperate together.
							</p>
							<p>
							I’ve always rooted and advocated for open-source development and I have been lucky enough for having the possibility to embrace
							this development approach throughout my career so far</p>
